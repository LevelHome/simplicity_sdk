description:
  "This component provides support for signature generation with deterministic ECDSA (RFC-6979) using Mbed TLS.\n

  WARNING: \n
  Adding support for deterministic ECDSA through Mbed TLS will preclude \
  regular ECDSA operations using the Mbed TLS API from being accelerated on Series-2 \
  devices. ECDSA operations on those devices using the corresponding PSA API are \
  unaffected. \n

  NOTE: \n
  The PSA Crypto component for Deterministic ECDSA (psa_crypto_ecdsa_deterministic.slcc) \
  is recommended over Legacy Deterministic ECDSA (mbedtls_ecdsa_deterministic.slcc) in \
  Mbed TLS for future support since the legacy low level crypto APIs of Mbed TLS is \
  planned to be removed from Mbed TLS 4.0 APIs."
