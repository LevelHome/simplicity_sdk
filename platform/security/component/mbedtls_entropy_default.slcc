package: platform
label: Default Entropy Source
description: >-
  This component can be used in order to make sure that a suitable component for
  an entropy source is included in the project. Depending on the device's
  capabilities, this can be either a hardware (TRNG, Radio or ADC) source, or a
  device-unique seed in non-volatile storage.

  - name: mbedtls_entropy_default
requires:
  # Require a default entropy source if we don't require one indirectly
  - name: mbedtls_entropy_source

  # Require actual hardware sources as long as we have them

recommends:
  # recommend NV seed for resolution instead of ADC, since ADC
  # requires taking ownership of the ADC peripheral
