description: >
  The Bootloader Application Interface component must be added to a project in order to use the Gecko Bootloader.
  When this component is included in a secure application project, a part of flash memory is reserved for Bootloader
  usage in the application linker file. This component also provides a bootloader interface for interacting with
  the Gecko Bootloader.

  Note: This component is not required for Gecko Bootloader projects. This component
  is only required for application projects that need Gecko Bootloader support.
