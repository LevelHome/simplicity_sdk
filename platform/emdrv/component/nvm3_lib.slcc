  The NVM3 driver provides a means to write and read data objects
  (key/value pairs) stored in flash. Wear-leveling is applied to reduce erase
  and write cycles and maximize flash lifetime. The driver is resilient to
  power loss and reset events, ensuring that objects retrieved from the driver
  are always in a valid state. A single NVM3 instance can be shared among
  several wireless stacks and application code, making it well-suited for
  multiprotocol applications.


  This component includes only the NVM3 driver core. To configure and create
  the default instance of this driver, the NVM3 Default Instance component
  should be included in the project.
