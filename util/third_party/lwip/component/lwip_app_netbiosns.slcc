    The LWIP NetBIOS-NS high layer application specifically programmed with the lwIP low-level raw API,
    this is an example implementation of a NetBIOS name server. It responds to name queries for a
    configurable name. Name resolving is not supported.
    Note:
    Device doesn't broadcast it's own name so can't detect duplicate names.
