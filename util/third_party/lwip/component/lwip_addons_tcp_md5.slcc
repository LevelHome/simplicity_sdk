description: >
  The TCP md5 component can be used for adding custom TCP header options and custom socket options.
  It does this by implementing the (seldom used) tcp md5 signature, sockets application, enable md5 signature
  on a socket after that, your connection (client) or all incoming connections (server) require tcp md5 signatures.
  The md5sum is designed to verify data integrity using MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5), The TCP MD5 option
  allows BGP to protect itself against the introduction of spoofed TCP segments into the connection stream.
  To spoof a connection using MD5 signed sessions, the attacker not only has to guess TCP sequence numbers,
  but also the password included in the MD5 digest.
