description: >
  C SDK for MQTT
  Note: The version provided with Simplicity SDK is present for running aws_test and validate the 
  low-level implementation of IoT API. This module is not used internally by any Silicon Labs 
  component.
  Be aware that The MQTT used by aws_test contains the following security vulnerability: 
  CVE-2019-13120 - "Amazon FreeRTOS up to and including v1.4.8 lacks length checking in 
  prvProcessReceivedPublish, resulting in untargetable leakage of arbitrary memory contents 
  on a device to an attacker. If an attacker has the authorization to send a malformed MQTT 
  publish packet to an Amazon IoT Thing, which interacts with an associated vulnerable MQTT 
  message in the application, specific circumstances could trigger this vulnerability."
