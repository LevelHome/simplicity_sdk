description: >
  FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
  implementation. The FTP Client facilitates file exchange between a client and
  any remote host over TCP.
  The TFTP Client facilitates file exchange between a client and any remote host over UDP. 
  This component provides an easy-to-use solution for downloading and uploading files from a remote host. 
  The TFTP client can be initialized with sl_tftp_clnt_init(), and the functions sl_tftp_clnt_get() 
  and sl_tftp_clnt_put() can be used to download and upload files, respectively. 
  Additionally, the block size and timeout options can be configured to negotiate between the server and the client, 
  optimizing the transmission.
  The component implements the TFTP protocol as specified in RFC 1350. 
  To ensure proper functionality, a TFTP server, such as tftpd-hpa, must be prepared on the remote host.
