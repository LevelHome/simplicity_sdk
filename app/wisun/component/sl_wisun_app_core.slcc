description: >
  The Application Core component is designed to offer essential utilities
  commonly used in Wi-SUN applications.
  The sl_wisun_app_core_util_connect_and_wait() function configures the network size setting, the TX output power, the certificates and keys. 
  The function is waiting for the connected state. Its final action is to initiate the Wi-SUN connection process. 
  The sl_wisun_app_core_network_connect() and sl_wisun_app_core_util_network_is_connected() functions also provide 
  an easy way to establish a connection and wait for it to be ready.
  Event handlers for basic Wi-SUN network events include the basic event handler implementations.
  The sl_wisun_app_core_get_current_addresses() function retrieves known IPv6 addresses.
  Use sl_wisun_app_core_get_state() function to get the status of the Stack API calls. 
  The sl_wisun_app_core_get_time_stat() function retrives the connection time, disconnection time stamps and total elapsed time in those states.
  Use sl_wisun_app_core_get_device_type() to get the selected device type for the project. 
  The device type can be changed in the Wi-SUN configurator interface. 
  sl_wisun_app_core_get_lfn_profile() and sl_wisun_app_core_get_lfn_params() provide an interface to access the selected LFN profile and its parameters.
