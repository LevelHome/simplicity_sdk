label: "Wi-SUN Application status over CoAP"
package: "wisun"
description: >
  The component implements status notifications over CoAP. 
  It can be used in any application to gather runtime information about devices. 
  The component should be initialized with the sl_wisun_app_status_init() function. 
  Conditional sending can be customized by implementing the sl_wisun_app_status_condition_cb() function. 
  Server and notification parameters can be configured in the sl_wisun_app_status_config.h file 
  or at runtime using the appropriate setters/getters. 
  When the application starts, the component is initialized automatically with the default values from the configuration header.
  The configuration interface provides options to enable or disable the expected statistics data from the nodes, 
  such as device information, execution time statistics, and neighbor information. 
  Notifications can be received on any CoAP server, such as the [libcoap](https://libcoap.net) server application.
  Over the prebuilt binaries, any custom library can be used to implement a CoAP server that receives the notifications from the Wi-SUN node.
