description: >
  Bluetooth Mesh Application Runtime Adaptor (RTA) provides a central resource
  guarding service for Bluetooth Mesh SDK App components. Component guard
  functions offer an abstraction layer for resource protection in baremetal
  or RTOS systems, so the components can be system-agnostic (baremetal, RTOS).
  BT Mesh RTA utilizes the Application Runtime Adaptor (app_rta) component to hide the
  differences between RTOS and baremetal systems. Consequently, the guard
  is implemented by a single mutex under RTOS, and it is NOP for baremetal
  projects.
