description: >
  The Event Statistics component provides insights into radio events, including
  transmission (Tx) errors and received packets (Rx). This component does not
  touch RAIL event configuration, developers can configure events in the
  corresponding RAIL Init instance. Additionally, the current implementation
  lacks DMP compatibility. Specifically, it does not filter events based on the
  RAIL handle, resulting in the collection of all RAIL events. To address this,
  consider implementing a filter within the event handler.
