label: "Duty Cycle Core"
package: "Rail"
description: >
  This component enables the calculation of preamble lengths for transmissions
  primarily driven by target RX consumption, i.e., how much time the RX node
  should spend periodically in reception (and in sleep state) without risking
  detecting the long preamble packet.
  Its functionalities include determining preamble length based on transmission
  parameters and initializing graphical resources. It also manages error
  display on LCD screens and presents normal operation status.
