label: On-the-fly LZJB Stream Decompressor
description: >
  An algorithm that can take an LZJB-compressed data stream transmitted in
  arbitrarily sized chunks (e.g. over a BLE connection with limited MTU size)
  and decompress it on-the-fly into a single, coherent memory output.

  The input stream must have no metadata or headers included, just the raw
  compressed data.
