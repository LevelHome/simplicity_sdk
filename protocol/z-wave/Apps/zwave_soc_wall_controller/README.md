# Wall Controller

The Z-Wave certified Wall Controller application shows a push-button switch panel implementation to control devices in the Z-Wave network from push buttons (physical or virtual) on a device that is meant to be mounted on a wall. Examples include scene and zone controller and wall-mounted AV controllers.

The Wall controller application implements a wall-mounted switch that has three individually configurable buttons. Each button has support for on/off and dimming.

The Wall Controller application is based on:

Use case:

The wall controller's three buttons are configurable to control nodes. Each button action is sent over the Lifeline as scene actions.

## Basic Command Class mapping

Basic Command Class is not mapped to any of the supported command classes.

## Association Groups

The following association groups are available for Z-Wave and Z-Wave Long Range respectively.

X: For Z-Wave node count is equal to 5 and for Z-Wave Long Range it is 1.

Y: For Z-Wave node count is equal to 5 and for Z-Wave Long Range it is 0.

## Usage of Buttons and LED Status

We are differentiating four different types of button presses. The following types are the same for the BTN0 and BTN1 on the WSTK board. The duration values can be configured under the config directory in app_button_press_config.h file in each generated application/project.

Please note external wakeup is not supported on button 1 in case of brd2603a and brd2603b.

## Firmware Update

This section will describe backward compatibility when upgrading the Wall Controller application from one SDK to a newer version.

Firmware update from previous versions should work without any additional steps.

## CLI Support
Please note the zw_cli_common component will modify the power consumption in case of sleeping applications. Like door lock keypad, sensor pir or multilevel sensor. CLI cannot work with sleep mode, after a reset the application stays awake until the user issues the enable_sleeping command. From that point CLI won't work  and sleep mode will be reached until the next reset.
