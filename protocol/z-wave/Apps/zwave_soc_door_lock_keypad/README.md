# Door Lock

The Z-Wave certified Door Lock application shows a lock implementation. It supports user codes to open a door and thereby eliminate the need for traditional keys. It is possible to both lock and unlock the door remotely through the Z-Wave protocol.

The Door Lock application is based on:

| <!-- -->                | <!-- -->                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Role Type               | Listening Sleeping End device (LSS / FLiRS)                             |
| Supporting Device Type  | Actuator                                                                |
| Device Type             | Lock                                                                    |
| Generic Type            | Entry Control                                                           |
| Specific Type           | Door Lock                                                               |
| Requested security keys | S0 and S2_ACCESS<br>The Door Lock features depend on the security level |

The application will only work when securely added to a network by a controller supporting security.
The controller MUST support security S2_Access_Control or S0 in order to be able to control the door lock.

**Not** implemented Door lock functionality:

- Timed Operation mode
- Door Lock condition
- Inside Door Handle State
- Functionality handling Lock timeout
- Target mode
- Auto-Relock, Hold And Release, Block to Block, and Twist Assist

## Supported Command Classes

The Door Lock application implements mandatory and some optional command classes. The table below lists the supported Command Classes, their version, and their required Security class, if any.

| Command Class             | Version | Required Security Class |
| ------------------------- |:-------:| ----------------------- |

| Transport Service         | 2       | None                    |
| User Code                 | 1       | S0 or Access Control    |
| User Credential\*         | 1       | S0 or Access Control    |
| Version                   | 3       | S0 or Access Control    |
| Z-Wave Plus Info          | 2       | None                    |

\*: The User Credential Command Class is only available on specific boards. See the section [User Credential Command Class](#user-credential-command-class).

### User Credential Command Class

The User Credential Command Class is enabled by default on the following boards:
 - BRD2705A
 - BRD4400B
 - BRD4400C
 - BRD4401B
 - BRD4401C

Support for this command class can be disabled if the User Code Command Class is sufficient, by disabling the *User Credential Command Class* component.

To enable this command class on other boards, due to flash memory constraints, it is recommended to first disable the *Z-Wave CLI Common* component before enabling the *User Credential Command Class* component.

The default credentials are created when the inclusion process finishes.

- If the User Code Command Class is enabled:
    - User Code 1 is created with a value of 3494.
- If the User Credential Command Class is enabled:
    - A Programming User with the unique identifier 1, called "Admin" is created.
    - A PIN Code associated with user 1 is created with a value of 3494.

To operate the door bolt with the default credentials, the end device must first
be included in a Z-Wave network.

## Basic Command Class mapping

The Basic Command Class is mapped according to the table below.


| Basic Command                       | Mapped Command                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------|
| Basic Set (Value)                   | Door Lock Operation Set (Door Lock Mode)           |
| Basic Report (Current Value = 0x00) | Door Lock Operation Report (Door Lock Mode = 0x00) |
| Basic Report (Current Value = 0xFF) | Door Lock Operation Set (Door Lock Mode)           |

## Usage of Buttons and LED Status

We are differentiating four different types of button presses. The following types are the same for the BTN0 and BTN1 on the WSTK board. The duration values can be configured under the config directory in app_button_press_config.h file in each generated application/project.

Please note external wakeup is not supported on button 1 in case of brd2603a and brd2603b.

## Firmware Update

This section will describe backward compatibility when upgrading the Door Lock application from one SDK to a newer version. 

## CLI Support

In case CLI support is needed pelase install zw_cli_common component to the project. Please note the zw_cli_common component will modify the power consumption in case of sleeping applications. Like door lock keypad, sensor pir or multilevel sensor. CLI cannot work with sleep mode, after a reset the application stays awake until the user issues the enable_sleeping command. From that point CLI won't work  and sleep mode will be reached until the next reset.
