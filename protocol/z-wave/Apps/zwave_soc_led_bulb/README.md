# LED Bulb

The Z-Wave LED Bulb application shows an implementation of a remotely controlled color 
switch. An example is a LED bulb or any other color capable device.

The LED Bulb application is based on:

## Basic Command Class Mapping

The Basic Command Class is mapped according to the table below.

| Basic Command                          | Mapped Command                             |
| :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| Basic Set (Value)                      | Multilevel Switch Set (Value)              |
| Basic Report (Current Value, Duration) | Multilevel Switch Report (Value, Duration) |

## Association Groups

The following association groups shown in the table below are available for Z-Wave and Z-Wave Long 
Range respectively.

<table>
<tr>
    <th>ID</th>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Node Count</th>
    <th>Description</th>
</tr><tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Lifeline</td>
    <td>X</td>
    <td>
        <p>Supports the following command classes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device Reset Locally: triggered upon reset.</li>
            <li>Color Switch Report: Triggered when the switch changes state.</li>
            <li>Multilevel Switch Report: Triggered when the switch changes state.</li>
            <li>Indicator Report: Triggered when LED0 changes state.</li>
        </ul>
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

X: For Z-Wave node count is equal to 5 and for Z-Wave Long Range it is 1.

## Usage of Buttons and LED Status

We are differentiating four different types of button presses. The following types are the same for the BTN0 and BTN1 on the WSTK board. The duration values can be configured under the config directory in app_button_press_config.h file in each generated application/project.

Please note external wakeup is not supported on button 1 in case of brd2603a and brd2603b.

## Firmware Update

SDK 7.14.0 is the first SDK, including LED Bulb. When there are new versions of LED Bulb application, backward compatibility notes will be added in this section.

## CLI Support
Please note the zw_cli_common component will modify the power consumption in case of sleeping applications. Like door lock keypad, sensor pir or multilevel sensor. CLI cannot work with sleep mode, after a reset the application stays awake until the user issues the enable_sleeping command. From that point CLI won't work  and sleep mode will be reached until the next reset.
