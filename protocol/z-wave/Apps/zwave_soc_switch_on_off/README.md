# Switch On/Off

The Z-Wave certified Switch On/Off application shows a switch implementation, that turns on any device that is connected to power. Examples include lights, appliances, etc.

### Basic Command Class mapping

Basic Command Class is mapped to Binary Switch CC

X: For Z-Wave node count is equal to 5 and for Z-Wave Long Range it is 1.

## Usage of Buttons and LED Status

We are differentiating four different types of button presses. The following types are the same for the BTN0 and BTN1 on the WSTK board. The duration values can be configured under the config directory in app_button_press_config.h file in each generated application/project.

Please note external wakeup is not supported on button 1 in case of brd2603a and brd2603b.

## Firmware Update

This section will describe backward compatibility when upgrading the Switch On/Off application from one SDK to a newer version.

## CLI Support
Please note the zw_cli_common component will modify the power consumption in case of sleeping applications. Like door lock keypad, sensor pir or multilevel sensor. CLI cannot work with sleep mode, after a reset the application stays awake until the user issues the enable_sleeping command. From that point CLI won't work  and sleep mode will be reached until the next reset.
