package: "Bluetooth"
description: >
  The Bluetooth high power component allows the device to use a high transmission power
  when the frequency adaptivity or the current channel mapping allows to do so.

  Low power mode is a mode where the frequency adaptivity is disabled or the current
  channel mapping with adaptivity enabled does not allow to use a high transmission
  power. In this mode, Bluetooth will use a transmission power that is not greater than
  the power limit setting. The power limit is set to 10dBm by default. Use BGAPI command
  sl_bt_system_linklayer_configure() in NCP/SoC mode, or the vendor HCI command 0xfc1b
  in RCP mode, to set the per-PHY power limits if the default value is not applicable.
  The limit must not exceed the maximum that the regulations in the region of use allow.
