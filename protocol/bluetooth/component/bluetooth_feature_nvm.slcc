  NonVolatile Memory  (nvm) feature

  Provides convenient methods for applications in NCP mode to manage user data in NVM3.
  This feature can only access data stored in the NVM3 key range assigned to Bluetooth. It
  is not possible to access NVM3 keys out of the Bluetooth assigned range.

  For applications in SoC mode, it is recommended to use NVM3 APIs directly.
