 * @brief Bluetooth Event System IPC
 *
 * The Bluetooth Event System IPC component (`bluetooth_event_system_ipc`) is an
 * optional component that can be included to use Event System IPC to deliver
 * Bluetooth events in an application that uses an RTOS. When the component is
 * included, the Bluetooth stack will not deliver events via callback functions
 * but uses the IPC mechanism provided by the `event_system` component to
 * publish events to the application.
 *
 * When `bluetooth_event_system_ipc` is included in the application, use the
 * APIs provided by `event_system` to create the subscriber event queue and to
 * subscribe to the Bluetooth events. To make sure the application does not miss
 * any event, perform the subscription already in the `app_init` function.
